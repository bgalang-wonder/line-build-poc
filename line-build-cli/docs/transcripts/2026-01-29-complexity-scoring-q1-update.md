 # Complexity Scoring and AI Prototyping - Q1 Update
 
 **Date:** January 29, 2026
 **Participants:** Brandon (Me), Doug, Rich, Jenna, Shin, others
 
 ## Summary
 
 Update meeting on Q1 line builds complexity scoring prototype. Key points:
 
 - AI workflow for generating precise line builds from notes/legacy data works well
 - Expanded data model captures material flow and HDR-level specificity
 - Built graph-based visual interface for visualization
 - Can derive HDR-specific complexity scores
 - Discussed building this **upstream of current line builds** to iterate faster
 
 ## Key Decisions
 
 1. **Build separately from operational data** - Avoid breaking production, iterate freely
 2. **Translate to legacy line builds later** - This enriched format can distill down to current format
 3. **Wonder Create implications** - Need to ensure this supports instant line build generation for custom bowls
 4. **Focus on speed line items** - Prioritize for Wonder Create launch
 
 ## Next Steps
 
 - Within 30 days: Regenerate whole portfolio with complexity scores
 - Validate generation of legacy line builds from enriched format
 - Connect with Infinite Kitchen Eng team on data schema needs
 - Get this minimally deployed (better than spreadsheet)
 
 ## Notable Quotes
 
 > "This could be the structured line build, but it requires the KDS to change."
 
 > "If someone comes up with their own Wonder Create version of a menu item, we are stuck within the workflow of the HDR."
 
 > "We're building the groundwork... unless we completely change future KDS layout."
