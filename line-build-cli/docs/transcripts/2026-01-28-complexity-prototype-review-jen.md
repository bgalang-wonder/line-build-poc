 # Complexity Scoring Prototype Review with Jen
 
 **Date:** January 28, 2026
 **Participants:** Brandon (Me), Shin, Jen
 
 ## Summary
 
 Demo of complexity scoring prototype to Jen. Showed AI-generated line builds with DAG visualization, material flow tracking, and complexity scoring.
 
 ## Key Topics Discussed
 
 ### Prototype Capabilities
 - AI agent creates structured line builds from notes/legacy data
 - Graph visualization shows component merging and station assignments
 - Already deriving complexity scores with station bounces and other signals
 - Adjustable weights for different complexity factors
 
 ### Time Data
 - Jen sending time trial data to incorporate
 - Discussion of theoretical vs real-time sequencer data
 - Could use time study data to populate step durations
 - Dynamic time updates from sequencer could feed into system
 
 ### Complexity Throughput Analysis
 - Want to aggregate complexity scores for peak time periods
 - Compare peaks at different HDRs to understand ordering behavior differences
 - Per-station complexity breakdown (hot pod, cold pod, speed, pizza)
 - Could explain why some HDRs can't complete orders as fast
 
 ### Future Possibilities
 - Correlation between complexity scores and guest feedback
 - Version tracking when processes change (tied to cookbook schedule)
 - Adding new restaurants and impact on overall complexity
 - AI suggesting different line build configurations
 - Testing variations across HDRs and tracking real-world success
 
 ## Notable Quotes
 
 > "We rebuilt this thing like 10 times in like a week... the iteration speed is just so crazy."
 
 > "If it didn't look so good, I don't think I'd be already jumping into these other ideas."
 
 > "There's never been a way to capture what's going wrong in the field and what's wrong with the line build."
